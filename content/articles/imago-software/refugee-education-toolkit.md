### Goals & Overview
The aim of this website is to present a toolkit to charities & organisations which provide educational services to refugees, which helps them to keep the sense of 'human touch' in their work, even when online.

Everything in the site itself has been built and designed completely from scratch by the team, following an **agile** approach to development. We have set ourselves ambitious deadlines to ensure that the clients have useful software to test and give feedback on as quickly as possible.

### Technology
By following the agile approach, we decided to build out only the most vital components as we went. This meant that to start with we just built the frontend and hardcoded everything that was seen. For this stage we used **react** and **typescript** as the frameworks, deployed to **netlify**, and used **yarn** as the package manager.

We are currently in the process of buidling a bespoke backend solution for the researchers such that they will be able to continue adding their research to the site in an easy way, while still benefitting from the design and infrastrcture we have developed for them. Our current research is in how to use a **django** backend and a stylised admin interface for simplified database interaction through a GUI.
### Collaborative Development
This project is still ongoing, but so far the biggest challenge has been in attempting to build for client's who are unsure as to what precisely they are looking for. This process has lead to a lot of lower-fidelity **prototyping**, regular **presentations** of progress, and **iteration** based on feedback from the researchers who are producing the information contained in the website.
