 I just really like games, and I'd love to make them with you.

I went to the University of Manchester as a mature student to try and figure some things out. I studied human computer interaction, which game 

Before that I was in the arts; I played guitar, did speech and drama, that kind of thing.

Now I want to combine all the skills I’ve learned academically, and through projects, into something bigger and more fun!

I made this website mostly using React, so I’ll put that in a list of icons somewhere that indicate I know a language.

Here's a photo of my dog, Bilbo. Because I'm self-concious.
