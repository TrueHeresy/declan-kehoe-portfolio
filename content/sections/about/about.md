I really like games, and I'd love to make them with you.

I went to the University of Manchester as a mature student to try and figure some things out. 

I got a 1st in human computer interaction - a mix of software engineering, psychology, biology, & anthropology - which fitted my interest in... everything, really.

Before that I was in the arts. I played guitar, did speech and drama, that kind of thing.

Now I hope to combine all of that into something fun (making games)!

Here's a photo of my dog, Bilbo. Because I'm self-concious.
